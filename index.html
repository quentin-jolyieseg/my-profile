        <h2>1. Who am I ?</h2>
        	<p>Hello! My name is Quentin, and I'm 18 years old. <br> Currently in the 1st year of the IESEG Grande École Program, I'm building my professional future through numerous internships.<br> Thus, both in the field of commerce and in the public service (National Police, National Assembly, Ministries, etc.) I was able to acquire a solid knowledge of our institutions and a first experience in the entrepreneurial world. <br> Rigorous, passionate and very persevering, I hope, through this profile, to be able to be useful by making the most of my (first) skills, while continuing my journey in the discovery of the company.</p>

        <p>Politics is my passion. I love discovering how my country is organized, the challenges of decision-making, which are constantly contested. <br> 
        To evolve in this field, I have done several internships (which you can find on my LinkedIn), at the National Assembly, at the Lebanese Embassy, at the Ministry of Ecology...<br>
        I hope to succeed in working in a field that includes economics and politics in the future!</p>
